Hi! I'm a freshman majoring in Computer Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I like writing op-eds and silly poems and taking photograph of people and stuff. I'm also learning how to skate!

This blog is a collection of what I found interesting when I learn about machine intelligence. Through this blog, I want to say big thanks to many universities and professors who made their courses and books available online so students like me can start to discover this exciting field.

Below are some really cute flowers on campus to light up your day :D
