Hi! I'm a freshman majoring in Computer Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I like writing op-eds and silly poems and taking photograph of people and stuff. I'm also learning how to cook phá»Ÿ! This blog is a collection of what I found interesting when I learn about machine intelligence.

Below are some really cute flowers on campus to light up your day :D
